# Conectada Model

Conectada Model is a machine learning model that can be used to code cybersecurity-based software programs. The model is trained on a dataset of cybersecurity-related code, and it can generate new code that is both effective and secure.

## Features

* The model can generate code for a variety of cybersecurity tasks, including:
    * Network security
    * Vulnerability scanning
* The model can generate code in a variety of programming languages, including:
    * Python
* The model is still under development, but it has already been shown to be effective at generating accurate and secure code.

## Upcoming features

* **2024 release:** The Conectada Model will be released in 2024 with the following features:
    * **Support for a variety of red team cybersecurity software:** The model will be able to generate code for a variety of red team cybersecurity software, including:
        * Nmap
        * SQLMap
        * BurpSuite
        * Metasploit
        * Nessus
    * **Instructions for using red team cybersecurity software:** The model will also be able to generate instructions for using red team cybersecurity software, which can help you to learn how to use the software or to create automation scripts.
